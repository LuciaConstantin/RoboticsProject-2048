# 2048 Game - Arduino  

## Introduction  
* This project implements the popular game "2048," commonly found on smartphones and computers, now brought to life on a microcontroller.  
* The purpose of this game is simple yet engaging: the player slides numbered tiles across a grid, merging them to reach the desired 2048 tile.  
* The idea behind this project was to create an interactive and engaging experience for my robotics course, and what could be more interactive than a game? Over the years, one game that has always stood out to me and kept me entertained on my phone is 2048. So I decided to take on the challenge of implementing a new version of this game using a microcontroller.  
* The main utility of this game is mainly for learning. It offers a practical insight into how both software and hardware components communicate in order to create a fully functional project.   
## Project Description  
   A 4x4 game board is displayed on an LCD screen. The player interacts with the game using a joystick. There are four possible directions in which the tiles can move using the joystick: N(up), S(down), E(left) and W(right). By pressing the joystick button, the player can return to the previous game state, effectively undoing the last action (the last move will be reversed).
